c_3_0_00_4_51 IN THIS VIDEO I WILL SHOW YOU HOW TO PREPARE DATA FOR KALDI
c_3_1025_14_1051_25 AWK IS QUITE USEFUL FOR WORKING WITH EHM SPACE SEPARATED TEXT FILES BECAUSE IT BREAKS ALL FIELDS AUTOMATICALLY BY SPACE AND IT HAS SOME HANDY OPERATIONS TO WORK WITH EHM VALUES LISTED FROM THESE FILES
c_3_1054_70_1056_93 LET'S CHECK
c_3_1059_17_1064_40 YEAH THAT LOOKS CORRECT
c_3_1066_39_1074_96 NOW WE HAVE TO REPEAT THE SAME FOR ALL TEN DIGITS WHICH IS A BIT BORING
c_3_1145_19_1152_50 OKAY I THINK I'M DONE WITH TEXT FOR TRAIN DATASET LET'S SEE WHAT WE HAVE THERE
c_3_1169_63_1176_53 YEAH IT'S ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED UTTERANCES THAT'S GOOD
c_3_1176_78_1182_66 NOW I HAVE TO REPEAT THE SAME FOR TRAINING DATA TESTING SET
c_3_1275_08_1279_46 OKAY THAT'S THIS LOOKS CORRECT
c_3_1279_58_1285_71 WE HAVE ALL FIVE HUNDRED UTTERANCES FROM THEO
c_3_1289_34_1308_06 YEAH AS YOU CAN SEE FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS CASE WE HAVE THREE UNDERSCORE THREE AS A PART OF UTTERANCE NAME BUT IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE TRANSCRIPTION WOULD BE THREE BECAUSE THREE IS NOT THE DIGIT
c_3_1308_07_1320_94 IT'S JUST AN ID OF THE UTTERANCE THE DIGIT IS SIX AND IT IS SURROUNDED BY TWO UNDERSCORES THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE USED TWO UNDERSCORES IN GREP
c_3_1329_78_1334_23 THE NEXT FILE US UTTERANCE TO SPEAKER
c_3_1335_22_1343_50 IT SHOULD BE AGAIN THE SAME UTTERANCE ID AND SPEAKER ID SEPARATED BY SPACE
c_3_1349_24_1359_77 IT SHOULD BE ACTUALLY EASIER WE JUST NEED TO GREP FOUR TIMES PER DATASET PER IN TOTAL
c_3_1360_09_1368_76 THREE TIMES IN THE TRAINING AND ONE TIME IN TESTING
c_3_136_91_141_47 HERE YOU CAN SEE THE INDIVIDUAL RECORDING FILES
c_3_1390_16_1395_72 HM I THINK I MADE A MISTAKE IN THE TEST SET
c_3_1396_03_1405_37 IT SHOULD NOT BE THEO IT SHOULD BE YWEWELER
c_3_1407_77_1409_83 I'M SORRY
c_3_144_97_153_03 FROM THE DOCUMENTATION I KNOW THAT EH THE NAMING WORKS AS FOLLOWS
c_3_1463_04_1472_50 OKAY THAT LOOKS BETTER BUT NOW I WOULD NEED TO LET'S JUST CHECK WE ALSO HAVE THEO
c_3_1479_63_1487_93 NOW TEXT FILE CONTAINS WRONG UTTERANCES
c_3_1488_80_1500_27 SINCE I KNOW THAT THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THE SPEAKER NAME I CAN QUICKLY FIX IT WITH SED
c_3_1530_90_1533_56 THIS LOOKS BETTER
c_3_1539_02_1547_62 YES I CAN FIND THIS UTTERANCE SO WAV SCP AND TEXT LOOK CONSISTENT
c_3_153_04_159_24 THE FIRST PART IS THE DIGIT WHICH IS PRONOUNCED IN THIS AUDIO FILE
c_3_1557_12_1561_90 OKAY WHERE DID WE STOP
c_3_1562_91_1573_62 IT WAS TRAIN AND IT WAS SPEAKER JACKSON
c_3_1590_90_1593_57 YEAH THAT LOOKS GOOD
c_3_159_25_166_51 THE SECOND PART IS THE NAME OF SPEAKER AND THE THIRD PART IS THE ID OF THIS RECORDING
c_3_1605_24_1612_11 NOW WE HAVE TO DO THE SAME FOR NICOLAS AND THEO
c_3_1657_29_1660_53 OKAY LOOKS GOOD
c_3_1665_94_1670_59 WE HAVE THEO WE HAVE NICOLAS WE HAVE JACKSON
c_3_1671_85_1679_74 NOW WE NEED YWELWER YWEWELER HM
c_3_1685_61_1688_66 AND WE NEED TO DO THE SAME TEST
c_3_1713_84_1715_59 COOL
c_3_1717_92_1736_86 OKAY THE NEXT IS CORPUS AND IT SHOULD BE IN DATA LOCAL AND THIS IS JUST A TEXT FILE FOR LANGUAGE MODEL TRAINING
c_3_1736_90_1749_40 LANGUAGE MODEL TRAINING IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM EVERYTHING ELSE IN ASR AND BECAUSE OF THIS THE FORMAT OF DATA IS ALSO DIFFERENT
c_3_1749_50_1759_52 ACTUALLY IT'S MUCH SIMPLER IN ONLY HAS DATA WITHOUT ANY LABELS OR ATTRIBUTES IT'S JUST TEXT
c_3_175_30_178_74 AND WE HAVE TWO THOUSAND RECORDINGS
c_3_1760_82_1781_02 AND FOR THIS WE NEED TO CREATE DATA LOCAL AND WE WILL USE CUT COMMAND TO GET THE TEXT FROM THE TO GET THE TRANSCRIPTIONS FROM THE TEXT FILE
c_3_1784_99_1793_84 THIS OPTION F TELLS CUT THAT IT SHOULD USE SPACE TO SPLIT FIELDS IN THE FILE
c_3_178_75_182_88 FIVE HUNDRED RECORDINGS PER SPEAKER
c_3_1803_26_1809_07 AND WE ONLY SORRY THAT SHOULD BE D
c_3_1809_81_1812_29 D STANDS FOR DELIMITER
c_3_1812_56_1820_31 F STANDS FOR FIELD AND WE WANT TO ONLY SELECT FIELD NUMBER TWO AND EVERYTHING ELSE
c_3_1822_01_1828_39 AND ALSO ACTUALLY WE ONLY HAVE ONE FIELD IN THIS CASE BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE ONE WORD
c_3_1828_42_1834_96 BUT USUALLY WE HAVE MORE THAN ONE WORD IN THE TRANSCRIPTION AND WE NEED TO SELECT MORE THAN ONE FIELD
c_3_1837_90_1840_81 IN THIS CASE IT'S ENOUGH TO SELECT JUST ONLY FIELD NUMBER TWO
c_3_1841_62_1847_28 IF WE WOULD SELECT FIELD NUMBER ONE FOR EXAMPLE WE WILL SEE UTTERANCE ID
c_3_1850_50_1857_53 OKAY LET'S SAVE THE RESULT TO DATA LOCAL CORPUS TXT AS THE TUTORIAL SUGGESTS
c_3_185_16_194_15 YEAH AS YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE FOUR SPEAKERS THEO YWEWELER NICOLAS AND JACKSON
c_3_1867_43_1877_78 BY THE WAY I USE LESS TO EVALUATE OR TO LOOK INTO TEXT FILES IT'S QUITE EHM CONVENIENT
c_3_1878_87_1886_05 IT CAN SHOW YOU ANY TEXT FILES OF ANY SIZE
c_3_1887_07_1893_58 AND TO JUMP TO THE END OF THE FILE I USUALLY USE SHIFT F OR CAPITAL F
c_3_1895_00_1918_15 AND IN THIS CASE IT SWITCHES TO AUTOMATIC UPDATES SO THAT IF THE FILE WAS CHANGED THE LESS PROGRAM WILL AUTOMATICALLY UPDATE WHAT IT DISPLAYS AND SCROLL TO THE NEW END OF THE FILE
c_3_18_64_27_70 THIS TUTORIAL SUGGESTS TO USE RECORDINGS OF SPOKEN DIGITS AND THEY ALSO SUGGEST TO MAKE IT ON YOUR OWN
c_3_1918_78_1926_90 TO EXIT OF THIS MODE OF WAITING FOR DATA I USE CTRL C
c_3_1927_15_1938_02 AND THEN I'M IN NORMAL MODE AGAIN AND THEN I CAN GO TO THE BEGINNING OF FILE AGAIN WITH G G I THINK
c_3_1938_38_1940_74 ACTUALLY G IS ENOUGH
c_3_1944_01_1949_07 OH AND SHIFT G CAN ALSO BRING YOU TO THE END OF THE FILE
c_3_195_20_204_09 I WOULD SUGGEST YOU TO USE THE SAME DATASET SO THAT YOU CAN COMPARE RESULTS AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS CORRECT
c_3_1963_35_1980_50 OKAY AND THE NEXT PART IS LANGUAGE DATA AND IT MAINLY DEALS WITH VARIOUS LINGUISTIC RESOURCES SUCH AS LEXICON
c_3_1983_27_1988_44 SO IN DATA LOCAL WE NEED TO CREATE DICT DIRECTORY
c_3_1996_33_2000_19 AND THERE WE SHOULD CREATE LEXICON TXT
c_3_2010_06_2028_70 I USE VIM EDITOR YOU CAN USE FOR EXAMPLE NANO IF YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH VIM BECAUSE VIM HAS QUITE SPECIAL WAY TO OPERATE AND IT MIGHT BE INCONVENIENT FOR YOU IF YOU ARE NOT USED TO IT
c_3_2034_04_2044_12 BASICALLY WE NEED TO COPY PASTE THIS CONTENTS AND WE WILL HAVE THE PRONUNCIATION DICTIONARY FOR OUR SYSTEM
c_3_2063_99_2082_46 SO HERE WE HAVE ALL OUR WORDS WHICH ARE JUST DIGITS AND PHONETIC TRANSCRIPTION FOR THEM WITH SOME PSEUDO PHONETIC ALPHABET SO TO SAY
c_3_2082_78_2101_90 AND TWO ADDITIONAL WORDS ONE IS UNKNOWN WORD WHICH IS USUALLY USED FOR TRANSCRIBING OR FOR LABELING THE AUDIO RECORDINGS WITH SOME WORDS WHICH ARE NOT CONTAINED IN THE DICTIONARY
c_3_2102_36_2133_51 AND ANOTHER ONE IS SILENCE WHICH IS USED TO LABEL PARTS OF THE RECORDINGS WITHOUT ANY SPEECH SO THAT THE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM CAN STILL GET UNAMBIGUOUS LABELS FOR ANY KIND AUDIO INPUT AND LEARN MEANINGFUL EHM MAPPING
c_3_2140_35_2151_52 TO CREATE A SPECIAL FILE WHICH LISTS ALL THE PHONES WHICH ARE NOT SILENCE
c_3_2152_48_2173_62 IT'S QUITE IMPORTANT TO SEPARATE PHONES OR LABELS RELATED TO SPEECH FROM ALL OTHER LABELS BECAUSE SPEECH IS QUITE DIFFERENT IN THE RECORDING FROM EVERYTHING ELSE
c_3_217_99_223_55 WE WILL START MAKING OUR OWN RECIPY IN THE EGS DIRECTORY
c_3_2242_54_2247_95 ALRIGHT I THINK WE HAVE FINISHED THE DATA PREPARATION PART
c_3_2248_50_2260_39 I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING BY HAND WITH JUST BASH COMMANDS AND WOULD SUGGEST YOU TO DO THIS THIS WAY AS WELL
c_3_2260_69_2268_91 JUST TO SEE WHAT KIND OF INPUT AND OUTPUT YOU NEED TO PROVIDE TO THE SYSTEM
c_3_2268_92_2280_38 NORMALLY ALL THESE OPERATIONS ARE AUTOMATED USING SCRIPTS IN VARIOUS LANGUAGES MAINLY BASH AND PYTHON
c_3_2280_39_2287_42 AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU AFTER FINISHING THIS TUTORIAL TRY TO WRITE YOUR SCRIPTS AS WELL
c_3_2289_10_2300_49 IF YOU WRITE ANY SCRIPTS WHICH CREATE THESE FILES AUTOMATICALLY PLEASE SEND THEM TO ME SO THAT I CAN CHECK IF YOUR UNDERSTOOD EVERYTHING CORRECTLY
c_3_2301_29_2312_66 OR ALTERNATIVELY YOU CAN JUST EVALUATE OUTPUT OF YOUR SCRIPTS AND COMPARE IT WITH FILES WHICH WE CREATED HERE BY HAND
c_3_2315_96_2318_62 SEE YOU IN THE NEXT VIDEO
c_3_235_16_241_42 LET'S CREATE S5 DIRECTORY JUST TO BE UNIFORM WITH OTHER RECIPIES
c_3_241_61_246_59 AS I MENTIONED BEFORE IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING IT'S JUST A TRADITION
c_3_267_34_282_32 OKAY HERE THE TUTORIAL TELLS HOW TO STORE THE DATA WE ACTUALLY WILL NOT DO IT BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE DATA IN SEPARATE DIRECTORY WHEN WE DID GIT CLONE
c_3_284_21_290_49 NOW WE SEE THE DESCRIPTION OF ACTUAL FILES WHICH WE NEED TO CREATE
c_3_28_33_34_36 EH I WAS A BIT LAZY AND FOUND A FREE PRE-RECORDED SPOKEN DIGITS DATASET
c_3_292_12_300_07 ALL DATASETS IN KALDI RECIPIES ARE USUALLY STORED UNDER DATA DIRECTORY
c_3_303_41_305_04 LET'S MAKE DATA
c_3_306_62_313_90 AND IN THIS RECIPY WE WILL HAVE TWO DATASETS ONE IS TEST AND ANOTHER ONE IS TRAIN
c_3_361_33_369_64 SO IN KALDI DATASETS ARE USUALLY DESCRIBED IN TEXT FILES
c_3_370_43_391_67 AND THE FIRST FIELD IS USUALLY SOME ID FOR SOME ITEM MOST IT'S UTTERANCE OR RECORDING ID AND OTHER FIELDS ARE SOME ATTRIBUTES FOR THAT ITEM
c_3_392_81_400_57 FOR EXAMPLE HERE WE THE DESCRIPTION OF SPEAKERS GENDERS FILE
c_3_400_93_406_13 IT LISTS EH ALL THE SPEAKERS AND THEIR GENDERS
c_3_406_83_414_17 WE WILL NOT CREATE THIS FILE BECAUSE I'TS NOT NEEDED FOR MOST OF THE SYSTEMS
c_3_417_63_427_84 OKAY THE NEXT FILE IS WAV DOT SCP AND IT'S ACTUALLY VERY IMPORTANT FILE BECAUSE IT LISTS AUDIO FILES
c_3_438_47_449_76 SO NORMALLY EHM NORMALLY IT CAN BE EITHER UTTERANCE OR RECORDING ID
c_3_449_77_459_95 IN THIS CASE WE SEE UTTERANCE ID BECAUSE IT'S ONLY ONE UTTERANCE PER RECORDING
c_3_462_09_472_59 ONE UTTERANCE IS THE SHORTEST UNIT OF DATA IN SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEMS
c_3_478_04_486_61 SO AS YOU CAN SEE WE JUST NEED TO CREATE A LIST OF FILES AND GIVE THEM NAMES
c_3_4_52_17_95 FIRST OF ALL FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION WE WOULD NEED AUDIO RECORDINGS WITH DURATION FROM TWO TO THIRTY SECONDS ROUGHLY AND TRANSCRIPTIONS FOR THEM
c_3_518_07_537_72 WE WILL GO ONE BY ONE OVER ALL FOUR SPEAKERS AND LIST FILES FOR EACH SPEAKER AND DIRECT THIS LIST TO WAV SCP
c_3_537_80_540_58 SO LET'S START FROM JACKSON
c_3_543_73_547_44 HERE ARE ALL THE FILES BY JACKSON
c_3_547_89_558_38 YOU CAN USE THIS PATTERN STAR JACKSON STAR TO LIST ALL FILES WITH THIS STRING IN THE NAME
c_3_560_89_575_74 NOW WE WILL USE A SHORT EH NO WE WILL NOT USE AWK WE WILL USE A FOR LOOP IN BASH
c_3_579_80_589_20 SO F IN THIS CASE IS VARIABLE WHICH CONTAINS ONE FILE NAME OR THE NAME OF ONE FILE
c_3_595_52_610_87 THIS BASH LOOP MEANS GO OVER ALL FILES AND PRINT THE NAME OF THE FILE FOR EACH OF THE FILE
c_3_613_22_620_76 I MADE A MISTAKE THERE IS ONE WORD MISSING YEAH NOW IT'S WORKING
c_3_624_25_632_01 OKAY BUT WE NEED NOT ONLY THE NAME OF THE FILE THE FULL PATH OF THE FILE WE ALSO NEED AN UTTERANCE ID FOR IT
c_3_633_00_638_77 FOR THIS WE WILL USE EH BASH SUBCOMMAND
c_3_63_94_85_70 YOU CAN USE CTRL R TO SEARCH FOR COMMANDS IN THE HISTORY FOR EXAMPLE I CAN FIND EH CD COMMAND TO CHANGE DIRECTORY TO THE TEAMLAB DIRECTORY OR TO CONNECT TO PHOENIX
c_3_641_38_647_26 SO BASENAME THIS FILE NAME DOT WAV
c_3_649_73_655_07 IT JUST PRINTS THE NAME OF THE FILE WITHOUT DIRECTORY AND WITHOUT DOT WAV IN THE END
c_3_658_61_663_36 WE CAN USE THIS AS A NAME OF UTTERANCE
c_3_666_65_684_60 BUT IN KALDI WE HAVE REQUIREMENT THAT EVERY UTTERANCE HAS TO START WITH SPEAKER NAME OTHERWISE THERE WILL BE A PROBLEM WITH SORTING IN DATASETS
c_3_684_63_692_95 SO I WILL ADD THE NAME OF SPEAKER TO THE UTTERANCE ID
c_3_697_55_705_00 OKAY AND FINALLY I NEED TO ADD FILE PATH AGAIN
c_3_705_79_715_01 SO AS YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE NOW UTTERANCE ID SPACE AND FILE PATH
c_3_715_48_719_02 LET'S SAVE THIS TO TRAIN WAV SCP
c_3_728_40_732_42 DONE NOW WE HAVE THIS WAV SCP FOR JACKSON
c_3_733_47_741_91 AND WE CAN CHECK THERE ARE ALL FIVE HUNDRED RECORDINGS FOR THIS SPEAKER
c_3_741_92_745_54 NOW WE HAVE TO REPEAT THE SAME FOR THE REST OF THE SPEAKERS
c_3_751_68_754_17 THE NEXT ONE IS NICOLAS
c_3_768_59_780_54 HERE I WILL CHANGE THE REDIRECTION COMMAND SO THAT IT DOES NOT CREATE THE FILE FROM SCRATCH BUT APPENDS THE OUT TO THE EXISTING FILE
c_3_786_06_794_97 NOW WE HAVE ONE THOUSAND ITEMS IN THIS FILE ONE THOUSAND LINES TO SAY MORE PRECISELY
c_3_795_38_798_01 AND WE HAVE NICOLAS IN THE END
c_3_799_91_802_75 NEXT ONE IS THEO
c_3_824_97_830_61 AND FINALLY THIS STRANGE NAME YWEWELER
c_3_833_70_848_75 WE WILL ACTUALLY USE IT FOR TESTING BECAUSE WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW WELL OUR SYSTEM WOULD WORK ON SPEAKERS WHICH IT DIDN'T SEE IN THE TRAINING DATA
c_3_857_32_867_69 HERE WE CAN STILL USE APPEND REDIRECTION BUT SINCE WE DON'T HAVE THIS FILE YET IT WILL BE CREATED FROM SCRATCH
c_3_867_70_871_31 WE COULD DO IT FOR TRAINING DATA AS WELL
c_3_885_99_889_68 I THINK WE HAVE FINISHED THE WAV SCP PART
c_3_892_69_895_13 THE NEXT ONE IS TEXT
c_3_895_98_905_89 FOR THIS FILE WE HAVE AGAIN THE UTTERANCE ID AND THE TRANSCRIPTION FOR THIS UTTERANCE
c_3_916_62_934_10 EHM WE WILL USE THE NAME OF THE UTTERANCE TO INFER THE TRANSCRIPTIONS SINCE WE KNOW THAT THE NAME ALREADY CONTAINS THE DIGIT WHICH IS PRONOUNCED IN EVERY FILE
c_3_934_11_950_21 FOR EXAMPLE ALL UTTERANCES WITH ZERO CONTAIN THE PRONUNCIATION OF THE DIGIT ZERO
c_3_951_92_957_23 TO GET LIST OF ALL SUCH UTTERANCES WE WILL USE GREP COMMAND
c_3_958_16_987_81 AND HERE I SPECIFY UNDERSCORE ZERO UNDERSCORE SO THAT WE DON'T GET FOR EXAMPLE THE UTTERANCES WHICH JUST END WITH ZERO WHICH WOULD BE INCORRECT BECAUSE WE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT IS CONTAINED IN THIS UTTERANCE BASED ON JUST KNOWING THAT IT ENDS WITH ZERO WE NEED UTTERANCE CONTAINING ZERO IN THE MIDDLE
c_3_998_96_1014_81 NOW I WILL ACTUALLY USE AWK TO PRINT THE FIRST FIELD AND THEN THE TRANSCRIPTION WHICH IS PREDEFINED IT'S JUST ZERO
d_4_0_00_10_19 IN THIS VIDEO I WILL SHOW HOW TO FINALIZE THE DATA STRUCTURE HOW TO FINALIZE THE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE FOR THE RECIPY
d_4_101_82_113_53 HERE WE CAN SEE THIS SYMLINK UTILS WHICH POINTS TO WALL STREET JOURNAL UTILS AND STEPS WHICH POINTS TO WALL STREET JOURNAL STEPS
d_4_114_09_130_36 FOR HISTORICAL REASONS ALL COMMON OR SHARED KALDI SCRIPTS ARE KEPT IN WALL STREET JOURNAL RECIPY AND ALL OTHER RECIPIES JUST LINK TO THIS DIRECTORIES
d_4_11_97_20_67 FIRST OF ALL WE NEED TO ATTACH ALL SHARED TOOLS FROM KALDI TO OUR RECIPY
d_4_130_76_133_76 WE WILL DO THE SAME IN OUR RECIPY
d_4_146_90_150_65 NOW WE CAN ACCESS UTILS FROM OUR RECIPY
d_4_151_00_162_16 AND THE FIRST THING WHICH THAT WE WILL DO WILL BE VALIDATION OF OUR DATA FROM PREVIOUS STEP
d_4_164_21_173_36 IT IS QUITE IMPORTANT TO RUN THIS SCRIPT AND ANOTHER ONE FIX DATA DIRECTORY
d_4_173_49_183_48 ON THE DATA AFTER YOU THINK THAT YOU FINISHED THE PREPARATION AND DATA IS READY TO BE USED
d_4_183_97_205_67 QUITE OFTEN IT HAPPENS THAT MANY MISTAKES IN DATA PREPARATION ARE NOT VISIBLE UNTIL SOME KALDI SCRIPT EXECUTES VALIDATION OR FIXES IT
d_4_205_68_219_06 AND WHEN IT HAPPENS ACCIDENTALLY OR SUDDENLY USUALLY YOU ARE NOT AROUND TO SEE THIS
d_4_219_07_232_89 AND IT TAKES TIME TO FIND OUT WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED SO IT'S GOOD IDEA TO RUN THESE SCRIPTS RIGHT AWAY TO SEE IF EVERYTHING IS GOOD WITH THE DATA
d_4_22_67_37_06 EH THE TUTORIAL TELLS US TO COPY THE TOOLS FROM WALL STREET JOURNAL BUT WE WILL JUST CREATE EH SYMBOLIC LINKS
d_4_235_22_243_41 AHA OKAY SO THE FIRST COMPLAINT IS THAT WE DON'T NEED DON'T HAVE SPEAKER TO UTTERANCE MAPPING
d_4_246_21_260_39 WE CAN ACTUALLY APPLY FIX DATA DIR AND WHEN IT SEES THAT THIS FILE IS MISSING IT GENERATES IT BECAUSE IT'S POSSIBLE TO GENERATE IT FROM UTTERANCE TO SPEAKER MAPPING
d_4_261_54_268_96 IT IS JUST INVERSE OF SPEAKER TO UTTERANCE
d_4_268_97_287_43 WE CAN SEE THAT IT ALSO SORTS IT IN PROPER WAY CHECKS THAT ALL FILES THAT LIST ATTRIBUTES OF UTTERANCES ACTUALLY LIST SOME COMMON UTTERANCES
d_4_287_46_303_09 AND REMOVES UTTERANCES WHICH ARE NOT MENTIONED IN SOME OF THE FILES IN THIS CASE THERE WERE NO SUCH UTTERANCES AND ALL ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED UTTERANCES WERE SAVES OR OR KEPT
d_4_303_10_305_08 NOW WE CAN VALIDATE AGAIN
d_4_307_46_312_09 NOW WE SEE THAT IT CAN NOT FIND FEATURES FILE
d_4_313_79_325_23 AND IT'S ACTUALLY NORMAL FOR THE MOMENT BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT YET RUN THE FEATURE EXTRACTION WE CAN SPECIFY THIS OPTION
d_4_327_54_343_93 NOW IT TELLS US THAT DATA DIRECTORIES SUCCESSFULLY VALIDATED AND IT MEANS THAT MOST LIKELY WE WILL BE ABLE TO USE THESE DATA DIRECTORY IN OUR RECIPY AND ALL THE FOLLOWING SCRIPTS AND THAT THERE WILL BE NO PROBLEM
d_4_346_15_351_62 WE CAN DO THE SAME FOR THE TEST
d_4_353_41_356_54 FIVE HUNDRED UTTERANCES ARE KEPT
d_4_364_44_372_82 AND IT'S VALIDATED SUCCESSFULLY BUT WITH ONE WARNING THAT WE ONLY HAVE ONE SPEAKER
d_4_372_83_386_31 BUT WE KNOW THAT'S ALRIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS OUR INTENTION TO USE VERY SMALL DATASET AND TO USE THREE SPEAKERS FOR TRAINING AND ONE SEPARATE SPEAKER FOR TESTING
d_4_38_12_43_56 THE SCRIPTS FROM KALDI ARE STORED IN TWO DIRECTORIES UTILS AND STEPS
d_4_391_72_407_48 OKAY ANOTHER THING IS THAT THIS TUTORIAL MENTIONS VOXFORGE MANY TIMES AS A MODEL RECIPY BUT IT'S ALREADY OUT OF DATE AND CURRENT RECOMMENDED RECIPY IS MINI LIBRISPEECH AS I MENTIONED
d_4_410_60_418_75 NEXT THING THAT WE NEED TO COPY IS A SCORING SCRIPT AND WE WILL COPY IT FROM MINI LIBRISPEECH AGAIN
d_4_434_39_437_83 WE ALSO NEED TO CREATE A LOCAL DIRECTORY
d_4_437_84_454_25 LOCAL DIRECTORY USUALLY CONTAINS SCRIPTS WHICH ARE SPECIFIC FOR THIS RECIPY AND NOT SHARED BETWEEN MANY RECIPIES AS OPPOSITE TO SCRIPTS IN UTILS AND STEPS DIRECTORIES
d_4_465_81_470_83 NEXT STEP IS LANGUAGE MODEL TOOLKIT INSTALLATION
d_4_473_11_478_60 WE NEED TO GO TO KALDI TOOLS AND CHECK THIS SCRIPT
d_4_47_05_50_18 LET'S CONNECT TO PHOENIX SERVER
d_4_491_15_494_31 LET'S READ THE COMMENTS INSIDE
d_4_503_03_508_51 SO WE NEED TO BE IN TOOLS DIRECTORY
d_4_50_19_53_62 CHANGE THE DIRECTORY
d_4_510_21_514_88 THIS IS TRUE WE ARE THERE
d_4_515_44_520_02 AND WE ALSO NEED TO HAVE THE SOURCE CODE FOR THIS TOOLKIT
d_4_521_06_533_28 IT CAN NOT BE INSTALLED AUTOMATICALLY AND NORMALLY YOU WOULD NEED TO GO TO THIS WEBSITE FILL OUT SOME FORM AND DOWNLOAD IT AND SAVE IT HERE
d_4_533_65_544_73 BUT AT IMS WE ALREADY DOWNLOADED THIS ARCHIVE AND WE CAN COPY IT
d_4_568_78_571_04 LET'S TRY TO RUN IT
d_4_57_16_59_80 AND GO OUR RECIPY
d_4_63_78_74_57 AND LET'S TAKE A LOOK FOR EXAMPLE TO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT ANOTHER RECIPY
d_4_686_79_691_67 ALRIGHT IT LOOKS LIKE IT FINISHED SUCCESSFULLY
d_4_692_39_696_93 LET'S PROCEED FURTHER
d_4_700_35_705_55 NOW WE NEED TO CREATE TWO CONFIGURATION FILES
d_4_706_34_718_74 THE FIRST ONE IS DECODE CONFIG IT'S USED FOR THE SCRIPT WHICH RUNS DECODING OBVIOUSLY
d_4_719_35_723_24 BUT FIRST WE NEED TO GO BACK TO THE RECIPY
d_4_730_35_733_29 AND CREATE CONF DIRECTORY
d_4_735_96_745_63 WE WILL ACTUALLY JUST COPY THE CONFIGS FROM THE MINI LIBRISPEECH RECIPE AGAIN
d_4_761_31_767_00 AS YOU CAN SEE THERE IS NOTHING TO READ IN IT
d_4_767_53_770_89 AND I THINK IT'S OKAY
d_4_772_23_776_75 AND ANOTHER ONE IS MFCC EXTRACTION CONFIG
d_4_77_04_88_58 IT IS CALLED MINI LIBRISPEECH AND IT IS ACTUALLY THE GO TO RECIPY FOR ALL BEGINNERS
d_4_791_18_794_69 THIS ONE ACTUALLY CONTAINS ONE OPTION
d_4_804_89_807_39 SEE YOU IN THE NEXT VIDEO
d_4_88_59_97_60 IT IS A MODEL RECIPY THIS IS RECIPY WHICH SERVERS AS A MODEL FOR ALL NEW RECIPIES
